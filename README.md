# MobWeb_LockAccountCountry extension for Magento

This extension forces the customer to enter an address when creating an account. The country of this address will then be forced for all addresses of this customer, by setting it as the only option in the "Country" dropdown in the following forms:

- Customer account: Edit address
- Customer account: Create address
- Checkout: Billing address
- Checkout: Shipping address

This means that each account can only be assigned to one single country.

## Configuration

No configuration required.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
